    "    Here are some steps to follow when analyzing trends in flight prices:\n",
    "\n",
    "Gather flight price data: Collect flight price data for several years for different routes \n",
    "and airlines. You can use data from websites such as Kayak, Expedia, or Skyscanner to obtain this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clean and preprocess the data: Clean the data by removing any missing values or errors.\n",
    "You can also preprocess the data by converting it into a time series format, grouping the\n",
    "data by month or week, or adjusting the prices for inflation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualize the data: Use charts and graphs to visualize the data and identify any trends \n",
    "or patterns. You can create line graphs to show the average prices for different routes\n",
    "over time, scatterplots to show the relationship between prices and other factors such \n",
    "as season or day of the week, or box plots to compare prices between different airlines or routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identify trends: Analyze the data to identify any trends in flight prices. Look for \n",
    "patterns over time or relationships between prices and other factors such as season\n",
    "or day of the week. You can use statistical techniques such as regression analysis or time series analysis to identify trends and make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpret the results: Once you have identified trends, interpret the results to gain insights into the factors affecting flight prices. For example, you may find that flight prices are generally lower during certain months of the year, or that prices are higher on certain days of the week.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the analysis to make decisions: Use the insights gained from the analysis to make informed decisions. For example, if you find that flight prices are generally lower during certain months of the year, you can plan your travel accordingly. Alternatively, airlines can adjust their pricing strategies to optimize revenue based on the identified trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, analyzing trends in flight prices involves gathering and preprocessing flight price data, visualizing the data, identifying trends, interpreting the results, and using the analysis to make informed decisions. By following these steps, you can gain insights into the factors affecting flight prices and use them to make informed decisions."
